
The limitation arises because CS-Flow (as described) doesn't have explicit positional encoding. This means:

The model relies solely on the convolutional layers to learn about the "where" aspect. It doesn't have a separate mechanism to tell it that a feature at one location is inherently different from the same feature at another location, unless that difference is learned through the convolutional weights based on the surrounding context.
When the feature maps are downsampled (to lower resolutions), some fine-grained spatial information is inevitably lost. The localization map generated from these lower-resolution features will therefore have limited spatial precision.



1. What CFLOW-AD Does
CFLOW-AD takes multi-scale feature maps from a frozen backbone (usually EfficientNet).

Then it flattens the spatial dimensions into a sequence.

Since the model loses spatial layout in the flattening, it adds hardcoded positional embeddings (like in Transformers) to inject “where” the pixel came from.

⚠️ These are not learned, just fixed sine/cosine encodings based on (x, y) positions.

2. The Problem with Hardcoded Positional Embeddings
💡 You’re telling the model where things are — but not letting it learn how spatial layout matters.

🔸 Limitations:
No flexibility: The position info is the same regardless of the data. It can’t adjust for different textures or patterns.

Doesn’t capture object structure: A scratch on a shiny car hood vs. scratch on brushed metal will have different context, but same (x, y) encoding.

Unaware of spatial relationships: Positional encoding doesn't tell how pixels relate spatially — it just says where they are.

Inadequate for complex anomalies: In real industrial images, anomalies aren’t just blobs — they follow edges, textures, seams, etc.

Think of it like saying: “This pixel is at (x=5, y=12)” — okay, but what’s around it? The model doesn’t know.
